1,Trump says he expects to have second meeting with Putin,SUPPORTED,SUPPORTED,True,19.24,7,False,"The claim states that 'Trump says he expects to have a second meeting with Putin.' The evidence from the source 'Trump says Putin Budapest summit could be back on — as Orban floats pipeline plan to ease off Russian oil' supports this claim. It mentions President Trump saying there's a chance of a meeting in Budapest, which aligns with the expectation for a second meeting. Additionally, other sources indicate ongoing discussions and potential meetings between Trump and Putin, further supporting the claim."
2,"Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump",REFUTED,REFUTED,True,14.53,7,False,"The claim states that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump, which is not supported by the provided evidence. The evidence shows that there were tensions between the Catholic Church and the Trump administration regarding immigration policies, but it does not mention any endorsement of Donald Trump by Pope Francis. Additionally, the sources are dated in November 2025, while the claim seems to reference a past event, which is also inconsistent."
3,The Hunger Games is a novel.,SUPPORTED,SUPPORTED,True,15.47,7,False,"The claim states that 'The Hunger Games is a novel.' The evidence supports this by mentioning the upcoming release of 'Sunrise on the Reaping,' which is explicitly stated to be a book written by Suzanne Collins. Additionally, the sources indicate that there have been other books in the series, such as 'The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,' further confirming that 'The Hunger Games' is indeed part of a novel series."
4,Barack Obama was born in Kenya.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,18.27,7,False,"The claim states that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, but the provided evidence consistently refutes this claim. The sources indicate that there have been ongoing efforts to question Obama's birthplace, with some suggesting he may have been born in the United States. However, these claims are repeatedly debunked. Specifically, a 2025 fact-check article explicitly states that 'Claims that former President Barack Obama is not a U.S. citizen or that his birth certificate was forged have been thoroughly debunked for more than a decade.' This directly contradicts the claim and provides evidence supporting Obama's U.S. citizenship."
5,Python was released in 1991.,SUPPORTED,REFUTED,False,16.15,7,False,"The evidence does not support the claim that Python was released in 1991. The sources mention Guido van Rossum creating Python in the late 1980s, but do not specify an exact year for its release. Additionally, the earliest reference to a specific date (2001) is related to when the Python Software Foundation began managing the project, which does not align with the claim about the initial release."
6,Atlantis was discovered in 2024.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,16.13,7,False,"The claim states that Atlantis was discovered in 2024, but the evidence indicates that the discovery occurred in 2025. Specifically, a Danish team uncovered a submerged Mesolithic settlement in the Baltic Sea in 2024, and this information is reported on November 19, 2025. The claim's specific year of 2024 does not match the evidence provided."
7,modi is PM of bangoladesh.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,15.34,7,False,"The claim states that 'modi is PM of bangladesh,' but the evidence consistently refers to Sheikh Hasina as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. Additionally, there is no mention or implication that Narendra Modi holds any position in Bangladesh's government."
8,shiek hansia is PM of bangoladesh.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,13.19,7,False,"The claim states that Sheikh Hasina is the PM of Bangladesh, which is incorrect based on the evidence. The evidence clearly indicates that she was the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh and has been sentenced to death for crimes against humanity. Additionally, the dates in the evidence (2025) do not match any specific year mentioned in the claim, but this discrepancy alone does not change the fact that her current role is not PM."
9,The Eiffel Tower is located in Berlin.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,17.54,7,False,"The claim states that 'The Eiffel Tower is located in Berlin.' However, the evidence clearly shows that the Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France. The sources mention events related to the Eiffel Tower in Paris, such as its closure due to a strike and its involvement in the 2024 Olympics medals. There is no evidence supporting the claim that the Eiffel Tower is located in Berlin."
10,The Great Wall of China is visible from space.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,15.74,7,False,"The claim states that 'The Great Wall of China is visible from space,' but the provided evidence refutes this by stating that the belief in its visibility from orbit was more myth than reality. The sources indicate that while some man-made structures are visible from space, the Great Wall does not fall into this category."
11,The capital of Australia is Sydney.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,9.74,7,False,"The capital of Australia is not Sydney, but Canberra. The claim provides incorrect information regarding the location of the capital city."
12,Nitish kumar won bihar election of 2024.,False,REFUTED,False,15.24,7,False,"The evidence clearly indicates that Nitish Kumar won the Bihar election in 2025, not 2024 as claimed. The sources consistently mention the results of the 2025 Bihar elections, where Nitish Kumar's NDA led to a resounding victory."
