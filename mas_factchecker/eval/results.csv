1,Trump says he expects to have second meeting with Putin,SUPPORTED,REFUTED,False,27.4,5,False,"The claim states that 'Trump says he expects to have a second meeting with Putin,' but the evidence does not support this specific claim. The sources provided discuss Trump's administration's efforts to negotiate peace with Russia and his reluctance to meet Putin without assurance of a deal, but they do not explicitly state or imply that Trump has publicly announced an expectation for a second meeting. Additionally, all the evidence is dated in 2025, which does not match the claim's unspecified year (likely intended to be 2024 based on context)."
2,"Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump",REFUTED,REFUTED,True,26.1,5,False,"The claim states that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump, which is not supported by the provided evidence. The evidence shows that Pope Francis strongly backed U.S. bishops in condemning Trump's immigration crackdown and urged humane treatment of migrants. Additionally, the dates mentioned in the evidence (2025) do not match the hypothetical 2024 year implied in the claim."
3,The Hunger Games is a novel.,SUPPORTED,REFUTED,False,27.58,5,False,"The claim states that 'The Hunger Games is a novel,' but the evidence indicates that there are upcoming prequel movies in the franchise, including 'Sunrise on the Reaping.' Additionally, one of the sources explicitly mentions that Suzanne Collins is releasing a new 'Hunger Games' novel titled 'Sunrise on the Reaping' for 2025. This contradicts the claim that it is solely a novel."
4,Barack Obama was born in Kenya.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,25.39,5,False,"The evidence provided does not support the claim that Barack Obama was born in Kenya. Instead, it suggests that Donald Trump's campaign is declaring that he believes Obama was born in the United States. This contradicts the claim and provides evidence against it."
5,Python was released in 1991.,SUPPORTED,REFUTED,False,24.08,5,False,"The evidence does not support the specific year mentioned in the claim. While the sources do discuss Python, they do not provide a definitive release date for the programming language. The closest information provided is that the Python Software Foundation (PSF) was established in 2001, which is after the claimed release year of 1991. Therefore, the claim is refuted as it provides an incorrect specific year."
6,Atlantis was discovered in 2024.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,24.8,5,False,"The claim states that Atlantis was discovered in 2024, but the evidence clearly indicates that such claims were made in 2025. The earliest reported discovery of potential Atlantis ruins is dated to November 18, 2025, which does not match the claimed year of 2024."
7,modi is PM of bangoladesh.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,25.98,5,False,"The claim states that 'modi is PM of bangladesh,' but the evidence consistently refers to Sheikh Hasina as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. Additionally, there is no mention or implication that Narendra Modi holds any position in Bangladesh's government."
8,shiek hansia is PM of bangoladesh.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,26.61,5,False,"The claim states that 'shiek hansia is PM of bangladesh,' but the evidence clearly indicates that Sheikh Hasina was previously the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and has since been ousted. The evidence does not support her current role as Prime Minister, nor does it support the year mentioned in the claim (2024 vs 2025)."
9,The Eiffel Tower is located in Berlin.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,27.33,5,False,"The claim states that 'The Eiffel Tower is located in Berlin.' However, the evidence clearly indicates that the Eiffel Tower is located in Paris. The sources mention events and facts related to the Eiffel Tower in Paris, such as beach volleyball stadiums and photo shoots, which further confirms its location in Paris."
10,The Great Wall of China is visible from space.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,28.06,5,False,"The claim states that 'The Great Wall of China is visible from space,' which has been refuted by the provided evidence. The sources indicate that this belief was a myth and not true, despite its widespread acceptance for decades. Additionally, the claim does not specify a year, but the evidence discusses events in 2025, which aligns with the current context of the information available."
11,The capital of Australia is Sydney.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,24.35,5,False,"The capital of Australia is not Sydney, but Canberra. The evidence provided does not support the claim that Sydney is the capital of Australia. Instead, it mentions events related to cities such as Darwin and Perth in the Northern Territory and Western Australia respectively."
12,Nitish kumar won bihar election of 2024.,REFUTED,REFUTED,True,26.31,5,False,"The evidence clearly indicates that Nitish Kumar won the Bihar election in 2025, not 2024 as claimed. All sources provided mention the results of the 2025 Bihar Assembly Elections."
